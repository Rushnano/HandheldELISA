1. Add capture antibody to the "work zone" and incubate for 25 minutes at room temperature.
2. Wash off any unincorporated anibodies with phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) or blocking buffer using blotting paper.
3. Incubate with blocking buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse again - see step 2.
5. Add the analyte solution and incubate for 200 seconds at room temperature.
6. Wash with blocking buffer / phosphate-buffered-saline link in step 2.
7. Incubate with the signaling antibody for 200 seconds at room temperature.
8. Follow with a rinse step like step 2.
9. Run your test. :)
